Here are some of my reflections on teaching over the years, from my time as a graduate student but also as an instructor. They should be useful to students as well as teaching assistants. This is mainly aimed at teaching assistants.

First, we should clarify what the goals of teaching are. They vary, but some include preparing students for jobs (this is more of a technical-college approach) and expanding students' intellectual abilities and outlook (this is more of a liberal arts college approach). Students should be made aware of your ideas of why you are teaching and what your goals are. You should feel free to ask about any goals that your students have.

Since college is such a new environment, students will likely not know how to navigate it, and will need support from other students, academic advisors, faculty, and other student services. In many instances, your role is not just "instructor/teacher" but more like "mentor/coach/guide." Many students would rather go up to you to discuss any issues they have, rather than you. The generic advice for how to talk to students about any issues they bring up are: (1) Validate their feelings by making the case for them for why they feel this way; (2) Ask questions to understand where they're coming from; (3) Find advice that matches what they need and haven't tried yet.

Often, students are reluctant to bring up issues they have because they are embarrassed or because they are unsure of how you would react. Students will disclose what they feel comfortable sharing, and you shouldn't press them on it. Here are a few examples of experiences that I've had. How would you handle them?

1) You're a TA for an 8 am calculus discussion section and you noticed that one student showed up on the first day and stopped showing up. There's an attendance policy, and the student is at risk of having their grade lowered or even not passing if they don't show up, so you e-mail them. The next day they show up and say, "Hey, I'm really sorry for not showing up. I have sleep apnea, and it's really hard for me to fall asleep. In the morning I get extremely tired and it's hard for me to show up to the discussion."

2) You're a TA for another calculus discussion section and it's time for the first quiz. You notice that one student who used to show up didn't show up for the quiz and now you have to give them a 0. You e-mail them and they say, "I know I missed the quiz, but I have really bad test anxiety."

3) You're a TA for differential equations and the first exam has been handed back. After class a student goes up to you and asks to speak with you. They mention that they did poorly on the test but they tried. They say, "I didn't do well, but I understand the concepts." They ask if they should drop the class.
