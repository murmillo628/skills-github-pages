A differential equation of the form $dy/dx = f(y)$ (only in terms of the dependent variable) is known as autonomous.

Generally, solution curves will either converge toward or diverge from these equilibrium solutions.
An equilibrium solution $y=y_0$ is

1) stable (or a sink) if, as $x$ increases, all solution curves with initial values close to $y_0$ have graphs that move closer to the equilibrium solution.
2) unstable (or a source) if, as $x$ increases, all solution curves with initial values close to $y_0$ have graphs that move away from the equilibrium solution.
3) semi-stable when the graph of at least one, but not all, the solutions with initial value close to $y_0$, moves closer to the equilibrium solution.

4)
