For students:

The fact is that in many places, much of your grade depends on how you do on a test. The first thing to know is that it's important to know the material well first. I am assuming that this is not a difficulty, so please refer elsewhere for tips on actually learning the material.

Assuming that, the key thing to keep in mind is that it's not enough to just show up knowing the material and then start doing the test. Think of a timed test like a job interview. Many of the questions are questions you can expect to answer, but some may be unfamiliar and you'll need to think about those more. Either way, you shouldn't just know the material and then show up to the test. It takes *practice.* Think about what you will be asked to do on a test. You will have a certain amount of time to answer several questions. So in order to predict how well you might do, you should practice answering common questions.

One way to get a good idea of what kind of questions you will be asked is to look at old exams. This is a valuable source of exam problems. However, be aware that doing well on these is not a guarantee that you will do well on the actual test. Think about what you are expected to know as a big pile. In previous tests, the instructor picks from this big pile. But if you only know how to do the problems that were picked, then you will probably have difficulty with questions you haven't seen before.
